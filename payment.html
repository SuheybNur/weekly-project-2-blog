            <h1>Surviving on 5 KSH a Day: My Family's Journey</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Joseph. I am a father of five, and every day, I earn only 5 Kenyan Shillings (KSH). My
                story is one of struggle, resilience, and hope as I navigate the challenges of supporting my family with
                such a limited income.</p>

            <h2>The Daily Challenge</h2>
            <p>Each morning, I wake up knowing that 5 KSH is all I have to support my family for the entire day. It's a
                constant challenge to make sure we have enough food and essentials. My days are spent making tough
                decisions and trying to stretch every coin as far as it can go.</p>

            <h2>How We Make It Work</h2>
            <p>To manage with such a tight budget, we use several strategies:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>I grow vegetables in our small garden to save on food costs.</li>
                <li>We barter with neighbors for essential items and services.</li>
                <li>I take on odd jobs whenever possible to bring in a bit of extra income.</li>
                <li>My children help by doing chores and contributing in any way they can.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Family Support</h2>
            <p>Even though we face financial hardships, our family bond is our greatest strength. We find joy in simple
                activities like playing games together and sharing stories. Our love and support for each other help us
                get through even the most difficult times.</p>

            <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>
            <p>Despite the challenges, I remain hopeful for a better future. I dream of finding opportunities that will
                allow me to provide more for my family and improve our quality of life. The hope for a brighter tomorrow
                keeps me going every day.</p>
